## About

Currently based in Singapore, pursuing a career in travel tech ([Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.net/)) and academia ([NUS](http://www.nus.edu.sg/)).
I am passionate about harnessing the latest technological advances in order to add value to the world.
I use this page to keep track of my collaborative fun projects outside work and my thoughts on Software Engineering.

## Projects

### Bike Sharing Analysis

This is a group effort to predict bike sharing demand using machine learning, please see the web app for credits.

- [Bike Sharing Predictor Web App](https://ardydedase.github.io/bike-sharing-predictor/index.html)
- [Formula (2nd order polynomial)](https://github.com/ardydedase/ardydedase.github.io/blob/master/bike-sharing-predictor/script.js#L31)
- [iPython Notebook](https://github.com/ardydedase/bike-sharing-analysis/blob/master/bike-sharing.ipynb)
- [Data set](https://github.com/ardydedase/bike-sharing-analysis/tree/master/Bike-Sharing-Dataset)

### [Skyscanner Python SDK](https://github.com/Skyscanner/skyscanner-python-sdk)
Python SDK for Skyscanner's API.

### [API Wrapper](https://github.com/ardydedase/apiwrapper)
Noticed a pattern and repeated pieces of code in Python API wrappers for simple requests and polling.

### [Amadeus Python Library](https://github.com/ardydedase/amadeus-python)
Python Package for Amadeus Travel Innovation Sandbox.


## Software Engineering
*I keep notes of what I learn from work experience and academia.*

### [Analysis Modeling](https://github.com/ardydedase/ardydedase.github.io/blob/master/content/software-engineering/analysis-modeling.md#analysis-modeling)
Analysis modeling in Software Engineering provides high level technical and business presentation of the Software Requirements.

### [Class Diagrams to Skeletal Classes](https://github.com/ardydedase/ardydedase.github.io/blob/master/content/software-engineering/class-diagrams-to-skeletal-classes.md#class-diagrams-to-skeletal-classes)
This can help you figure out how you structure your classes and find out the possible flaws in your design before you start writing the code.

### [Software Security Concepts](https://github.com/ardydedase/ardydedase.github.io/blob/master/content/software-engineering/security-concepts.md#software-security-concepts)
This will cover sofware security fundamentals with some of its most common use cases.

### [Cryptography Basics](https://github.com/ardydedase/ardydedase.github.io/blob/master/content/software-engineering/cryptography.md#cryptography)
The foundation of how our transactions over the internet are secured.
