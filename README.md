## About me

Currently based in Singapore, pursuing a career in travel tech ([Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.net/)) and academia ([NUS](http://www.nus.edu.sg/)).
I am passionate about harnessing the latest technological advances in order to add value to the world.
I use this page to keep track of my collaborative fun projects outside work and my thoughts on Software Engineering.
